Option 1: Update Node.js with NVM (Node Version Manager)
The best way to upgrade Node.js is with NVM, a practical tool for managing multiple Node.js versions.

1. Start by updating the package repository with the command:

sudo apt update
2. Download the following dependencies by typing:

sudo apt install build-essential checkinstall libssl-dev
3. Install NVM using the curl command:

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.35.1/install.sh | bash
4. Close and reopen the terminal.

5. Then, verify if you have successfully installed NVM:

nvm --version
check nvm version to update Node.js
6. Before upgrading Node.js, check which version you have running on the system:

nvm ls
7. Now you can check for newly available releases with:

nvm ls-remote
see a list of all available Node.js versions
8. To install the latest version, use the nvm command with the specific Node.js version:

nvm install [version.number]

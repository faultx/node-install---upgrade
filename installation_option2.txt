f you want to upgrade Node.js from the command line, use the n model within the npm command. The n feature allows you to interact with different Node.js versions.

1. Before updating the Node.js release, check which version you are currently using with:

node -v
2. Next, clear npm cache with the command:

npm cache clean -f
3. Install n globally:

npm install -g n
4. Now that you have n installed, you can use the module to install the latest stable release of Node.js:

sudo n stable
Alternatively, you can install the Node.js release with the latest features:

sudo n latest
Or, install a specific version number with:

n [version.number]
